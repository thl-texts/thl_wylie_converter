# XML Wylie to Unicode Converter

This is a simple script that uses Elie Roux's [pyewts](https://github.com/OpenPecha/pyewts) from his
[Open Pecha Project](https://github.com/OpenPecha) (which I highly recommend) to convert an XML file of 
Wylie transliteration into Unicode Tibetan with the TEI milestone markers that UVA Tibetan projects use. 
This is based of a specific example of NGB XML files found 
[here](https://github.com/brunogml/rKTs/tree/master/etexts/Gpb) but could easily be generalized as the need arises.

It is nothing special. I am just posting it here to save me the time in the future.
